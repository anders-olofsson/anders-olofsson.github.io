<h1>RAW_DATA</h1>
<section>
    <p>
        All modern organizations depend on raw data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often, data is collected from the business itself and from analytics tools. The data is then persisted, transformed and exposed to departments within
        the organization, end consumers and b2b partners.
    </p>
    <p>
        To handle its data, many companies use programming languages and tools such as Java, Python, SQL, NoSQL, Kafka, Hadoop, Spark, Elasticsearch and Splunk.
        REST has become a popular alternative for serving data via APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Raw Data is a company that can assist your organization when it comes to software development -- especially when the aforementioned
        technologies are utilized.
