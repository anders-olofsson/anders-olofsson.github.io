<h1>RAW_DATA</h1>

<p>
Organizations working with information technology need raw data.

Often, data is collected from the business side, or through analytics tools. The data is often persisted, transformed and shipped around within the organization.

To handle data, many companies use programming languages and tools such as Java, Python, SQL, NoSQL, MQ and Kafka.

To make data available to stakeholders, both internal and external, REST has become a popular alternative.

Raw Data is a company that can assist your organization when it comes to software development in general and especially when the software is related to the previously mentioned technologies.
