<h1>RAW_DATA</h1>
<section>
    <p>
        All modern organizations depend on raw data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often, data is collected from the business and analytics tools. The data is then persisted, transformed and exposed to departments within the
        organization, end consumers and b2b partners.
    </p>
    <p>
        To handle its data, many companies use programming languages and tools such as Java, Python, SQL, NoSQL, Kafka, Hadoop and Spark. REST has become a
        popular alternative for serving data via APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Raw Data is a company that can assist your organization when it comes to software development in general -- especially when the aforementioned
        technologies are utilized.
